# How to use this directory

Please commit a short (1 or 2 paragraphs) markdown file to this directory every week that you're working on this project.

Each file should begin with a YAML header that contains the following fields:

title: A Few Words Saying What You're Up To
author: Your Name
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [literature, development, blocker, experiment, whatever]
abstract: A few more words expanding on what the post is about.

```

This blog is for internal use only. Think of it as a shared technical journal. There's no need to worry too much about polishing the texts. The idea is just for us to gain better insight into what each of us is doing, to prompt reflection on the project, and to gather together raw material that can be worked up into a milestone report every now and again.

Possible contents of the notes may include:

- high level code documentation
- a venue for rubber duck debugging and discussing stubborn problems and blockers
- writing up provisional experimental results
- planning future experiments
- a tomb for abandoned ideas and dead ends
- reading notes for relevant scientific and technical literature

I'm going to set up a few cronjobs to synchronize this directory with a P'Log server, which will serve the markdown as a blog.
