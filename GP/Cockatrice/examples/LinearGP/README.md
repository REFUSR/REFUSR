Linear Genetic Programming
==========================

A simple, illustrative example of a package using Cockatrice.jl.

This package contains a linear genetic programming system, and is able to evolve a classifier for simple, categorical datasets. The genotypes are sequences of register-transfer instructions for a rudimentary floating point virtual machine.
