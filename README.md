# The Internal Blog

The internal blog is up at <https://refusr.eschatronics.ca>. You can the following credentials to access it:

```
Username: REFUSR
Password: ghostridersinthesky
```

The reason for password protecting it is really just to give us a nice privacy fence, so that we can post material while it's still in a rough, in-progress sort of state, without worrying about exposing it to the entire world. Everyone with read access to this git repo should be understood to have access to the blog.
